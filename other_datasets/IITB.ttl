        nif:isString    "    New User? - Navigation Primary Navigation Secondary Navigation Search Former Taliban minister denies Afghan peace talks By Jon Hemming Reuters - 1 hour 52 mins ago KABUL (Reuters) - Former Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil on Wednesday denied a meeting he attended with Afghan government officials in Saudi Arabia last month constituted peace talks aimed at ending the seven-year conflict. The meeting, hosted by Saudi King Abdullah, could still help open the way to dialogue between the Western-backed Afghan government and the Taliban to end fighting that has killed more than 3,800 people already this year, a third of them civilians. \"It's totally wrong news. There were no talks and no Taliban representative was there. It was an ordinary and normal meeting and dinner,\" Muttawakil told the Pakistan-based AIP news agency. \"During our meetings with delegations from different countries, everybody talked about the problems of and expressed concerns and similarly, we came to know Saudi Arabia is also concerned,\" he said. \"But neither were there formal negotiations, nor did Taliban representatives attend those discussions.\" Muttawakil's comments follow similar denials from the Afghan government and other former Taliban present at the meeting. But while the former foreign minister, always regarded as a moderate in the austere Islamist movement, insists he is no longer a member of the Taliban, he and others present in Saudi are believed to have regular contacts with the insurgents. Afghan President Hamid Karzai made a direct appeal for peace to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar last week and asked Saudi Arabia to help mediate talks, but the Afghan government also denies any talks have yet taken place. With more than 60,000 troops in Afghanistan, NATO-led and U.S. forces have already suffered more casualties this year than in any entire year since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 for refusing to give up al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11 attacks. BREAK WITH AL QAEDA? While Western officials, including U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates, recognise reconciliation must be part of the solution in Afghanistan, it would be hard for them to make any accommodation with the Taliban while the movement still has ties with al Qaeda. Saudi Arabia, one of only three countries to recognise the Taliban government in the late 1990s, would also insist the insurgents break with al Qaeda and Saudi-born Osama bin Laden. But the Taliban is by no means a fully unified group and has allies, such as the Haqqani network operating in eastern Afghanistan, that analysts say are reliant on al Qaeda support. In a possible sign of de-escalation of the conflict, the Taliban said on Wednesday they would not attack food and aid convoys as long as they were destined for Afghan civilians and the insurgents were informed in advance. The statement comes two days after the U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, appealed to the Taliban and its leaders to ensure safe access for humanitarian programmes, including food distribution and polio vaccination. \"If we are sure that all food in the convoy is meant for the common people, we will never attack it,\" Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told AIP. \"The United Nations should contact the mujahideen before sending food supplies to areas controlled by the Taliban and not bring police and other forces along with them and then the Taliban will not attack them,\" he said. Attacks on aid workers and convoys have increased with more than 120 incidents this year as a result of which 30 aid workers have been killed and a further 92 abducted, according to the United Nations.

Deputy government spokesman Thomas Steg told journalists that such demands for an Afghanistan exit strategy timetable were 'negligent and problematic'. \"Any debate about a possible end of the (Afghan) mandate is negligent,\" he reiterated. The reconstruction of the Afghan state cannot take place by simply 'pushing a button', Steg said. He added no one could say when the Afghan people would be able to take over their own security. The German cabinet approved earlier in the day a 14-month extension of German troop deployment in Afghanistan. It also agreed to raise the number of Afghanistan-based German soldiers from 3,500 to 4,500 soldiers as part of a bill to be discussed by the parliament later in the day. The German Parliament is expected to approve the bill once it comes up for vote in mid-October. Germany has deployed around 3,500 soldiers in northern Afghanistan and Kabul as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in addition to police instructors and civilian reconstruction workers.

Six points from two matches,\" the Liverpool forward told Dagbladet.\n\n\"It would a be a dream it we could make that nine points on Wednesday evening. Obviously that's what we're aiming for.\"\n\nNorway's 0-0 draw in Scotland last Saturday has left the Scandinavians four points behind Holland in the table, although Kuyt is not expecting his team to have things their own way in Oslo.\n\n\"We know what we'll be up against in Norway,\" he continued. \"It's difficult playing at Ullevaal, very difficult.\n\n\"The Norwegian side has a lot of quality and I heard they played well in Scotland. A goalless draw at Hampden Park is very respectable.\"\n\nThe match will also give Kuyt the chance to play against former Liverpool team-mate John Arne Riise - a prospect the ex-Feyenoord man is relishing.\n\n\"He's a good friend and sometimes we used to play golf together. He's not a bad golfer either and often beat me. That gives me something to avenge in Oslo,\" Kuyt joked.\n\nFor Ajax striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, victory on Wednesday will give Holland the chance to start to thinking about South Africa in two years time.\n\n\"The prospects are rosy, that much is clear,\" he told Sportweek.\n\n\"It's a bit premature to be packing our suitcases, but if we get a good result against Norway we will have come along way in our journey.\n\n\"I have a good feeling about it, but we must first achieve it of course.\"\n" .

        nif:isString    "For years now, calories have been all the rage -- people are counting them and cutting them, and you'd be hard-pressed to find something at the supermarket that does not list its calories per serving somewhere on the package. But have you ever wondered what exactly a calorie is?\n\n\nWhat Is A Calorie?\n\nA calorie is a unit of energy. We tend to associate calories with food, but they apply to anything containing energy. For example, a gallon (about 4 liters) of gasoline contains about 31,000,000 calories.\n\nSpecifically, a calorie is the amount of energy, or heat, it takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). One calorie is equal to 4.184 joules, a common unit of energy used in the physical sciences.\n\nMost of us think of calories in relation to food, as in \"This can of soda has 200 calories.\" It turns out that the calories on a food package are actually kilocalories (1,000 calories = 1 kilocalorie). The word is sometimes capitalized to show the difference, but usually not. A food calorie contains 4,184 joules. A can of soda containing 200 food calories contains 200,000 regular calories, or 200 kilocalories. A gallon of gasoline contains 31,000 kilocalories.\n\nThe same applies to exercise -- when a fitness chart says you burn about 100 calories for every mile you jog, it means 100 kilocalories. For the duration of this article, when we say \"calorie,\" we mean \"kilocalorie.\"\n\n\nWhat Calories Do?\n\nHuman beings need energy to survive -- to breathe, move, pump blood-- and they acquire this energy from food.\n\nThe number of calories in a food is a measure of how much potential energy that food possesses. A gram of carbohydrates has 4 calories, a gram of protein has 4 calories, and a gram of fat has 9 calories. Foods are a compilation of these three building blocks. So if you know how many carbohydrates, fats and proteins are in any given food, you know how many calories, or how much energy, that food contains.\n\nIf we look at the nutritional label on the back of a packet of maple-and-brown-sugar oatmeal, we find that it has 160 calories. This means that if we were to pour this oatmeal into a dish, set the oatmeal on fire and get it to burn completely (which is actually pretty tricky), the reaction would produce 160 kilocalories (remember: food calories are kilocalories) -- enough energy to raise the temperature of 160 kilograms of water 1 degree Celsius.\n\nIf we look closer at the nutritional label, we see that our oatmeal has 2 grams of fat, 4 grams of protein and 32 grams of carbohydrates, producing a total of 162 calories (apparently, food manufacturers like to round down). Of these 162 calories, 18 come from fat (9 cal x 2 g), 16 come from protein (4 cal x 4 g) and 128 come from carbohydrates (4 cal x 32 g).\n\nOur bodies \"burn\" the calories in the oatmeal through metabolic processes, by which enzymes break the carbohydrates into glucose and other sugars, the fats into glycerol and fatty acids and the proteins into amino acids.\n\nThese molecules are then transported through the bloodstream to the cells, where they are either absorbed for immediate use or sent on to the final stage of metabolism in which they are reacted with oxygen to release their stored energy.\n\n\nYour Caloric Needs\n\nJust how many calories do our cells need to function well? The number is different for every person. You may notice on the nutritional labels of the foods you buy that the \"percent daily values\" are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\n\n2,000 calories is a rough average of what a person needs to eat in a day, but your body might need more or less than 2,000 calories. Height, weight, gender, age and activity level all affect your caloric needs.\n\n\nCalories, Fat and Exercise\n\nSo what happens if you take in more or fewer calories than your body burns? You either gain or lose fat, respectively. An accumulation of 3,500 extra calories is stored by your body as 1 pound of fat -- fat is the body's way of saving energy for a rainy day. If, on the other hand, you burn 3,500 more calories than you eat, whether by exercising more or eating less, your body converts 1 pound of its stored fat into energy to make up for the deficit.\n\nOne thing about exercise is that it raises your metabolic rate not only while you're huffing and puffing on the treadmill. Your metabolism takes a while to return to its normal pace. It continues to function at a higher level; your body burns an increased number of calories for about two hours after you've stopped exercising.\n\n\nLots of people wonder if it matters where their calories come from. At its most basic, if we eat exactly the number of calories that we burn and if we're only talking about weight, the answer is no -- a calorie is a calorie.\n\nA protein calorie is no different from a fat calorie -- they are simply units of energy. As long as you burn what you eat, you will maintain your weight; and as long as you burn more than you eat, you'll lose weight.\n\nBut if we're talking nutrition, it definitely matters where those calories originate. Carbohydrates and proteins are healthier sources of calories than fats. Although our bodies do need a certain amount of fat to function properly -- an adequate supply of fat allows your body to absorb the vitamins you ingest -- an excess of fat can have serious health consequences. \n" .

Gates, speaking aboard a plane en route to a visit with European ministers, indicated he will again press NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan during an alliance meeting in Budapest on Thursday and Friday. \"We continue to see the need for additional forces in Afghanistan,\" Gates said. \"I want to make sure that everybody understands that the increase in US forces are not seen as replacements for Nato contributions, but as reinforcement.\" In response to blunt remarks from Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, Britain's top commander in Afghanistan, who said in an interview published Sunday that \"we're not going to win this war,\" Gates said: \"While we face significant challenges in Afghanistan there certainly is no reason to be defeatist or to underestimate the opportunity to be successful in the long run.\" On the question of possible peace negotiations with the Taliban , a move sought by the Afghan government, Gates said he endorsed the idea, calling it a \"key long-term solution.\" \"What is important is detaching those who are reconciliable and who are willing to be part of the future of the country from those who are irreconciliable,\" said Gates. He added: \"Part of the solution is strenghtening the Afghan security forces, part of the solution is reconciliation with people who are willing to work with the Afghan.\" The defense secretary noted that a major issue during the upcoming NATO visit will be Russia 's \"overreaction in Georgia.\" The secretary said he was \"pleased\" that Moscow appears to be \"fulfilling the commitment that they made to (French) president (Nicolas) Sarkozy.\" Sarkozy helped negotiate a cease-fire plan between Russia and Georgia, who fought a brief multi-day war in August. But, said Gates, it is important to convey the message to Russia \"that it really can't be business as usual after what happened in Georgia.\"\n" .

For more than six testy innings against the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday, he threw them with cleverness and crankiness. Then, in a single energizing moment, he threw one with a message. The ball sailed behind the head of the Phillies' Shane Victorino, missing the player but thumping his team and denting this series. \"It was not a message to them, it was a message to us,\" Dodgers catcher Russell Martin said. \"We will not be pushed around.\" Yeah, Kuroda said that. Judging from the way they whined and wailed and ultimately wilted, the Phillies also understood him completely. From the moment the Phillies began pitching inside last week, Dodgers hitters quietly fumed that their pitchers wouldn't protect them. \"We didn't send a message,\" Manny Ramirez said. Kuroda may not speak much English, but somehow he heard. He may be one of the quiet, forgotten members of the staff, but he had been doing this for 10 seasons in Japan, and he figured it out. \"I didn't think I could hold them down unless I worked both sides of the plate,\" he said through an interpreter.\n" .

Violence has surged in the war-torn country with some 3,800 people, a third of them civilians, killed as a result of the conflict by the end of July this year, according to the United Nations. U.S.-led coalition and Afghan security forces killed 43 militants during heavy fighting in Qalat district of southern Zabul province Sunday, the U.S. military said in a statement Tuesday. \"ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces ) and coalition forces on a patrol received heavy weapons, machine gun and sniper fire from militants in multiple locations,\" the U.S. military said in a statement. The combined forces responded with small arms fire , rocket propelled grenades and close air support , killing the militants, it said. No Afghan or U.S.-led troops were killed or wounded during incident, it said. In a separate incident, Afghan and international troops killed 16 Taliban insurgents and wounded six more during a gun battle in Nad Ali district of southern Helmand province on Monday, provincial police chief Asadullah Sherzad told Reuters.

        nif:isString    "Cheap, Off-Grid Cooling\nA hybrid refrigerator will bring efficient, cheap cooling to Indi\n\nA startup based in Cambridge, MA, has developed a new solar-powered refrigeration system for food storage in Indian villages that are off the grid. Promethean Power Systems' design is a hybrid of conventional compressor-based refrigeration and thermoelectric materials--semiconductors that convert electricity into cooling and vice versa.\n\nThe chilling units will be cheaper than what is currently used in Indian villages, most of which are off the grid. In such villages, food distributors and processors store raw food products in traditional compressor-based cooling units that run on diesel generators. These cost about $12,000, says the company's cofounder Sorin Grama. And that cost, says Grama, doesn't include the escalating cost of diesel needed to run the units. During a month spent in India a year ago, Grama and his cofounder, Sam White, identified a crucial niche. \"Customers kept asking for a cooling system that has low maintenance and operation cost,\" White says.\n\nGrama says that even including the expense of the photovoltaic (PV) panels, his design would cost about the same as or slightly less than the diesel-powered refrigeration units. More important, it would have no fuel costs, and almost no maintenance costs. According to the company's initial calculations, using a compressor combined with thermoelectric modules would use 20 percent less power to generate the same cooling as a compressor alone.\n\nThe design uses off-the-shelf components: silicon PV panels, thermoelectric modules, and a compressor-based refrigeration unit. The company's control system directs the two cooling components to work together so that they squeeze as much juice out of the solar panels as possible, Grama explains. Early in the morning and late in the afternoon, when the amount of sunlight is low, the solar panels won't generate enough power to run the compressor. But there will be enough solar power to run the thermoelectric modules, which would generate cooling until the compressor kicks in. Around midday, when the solar panels are working full throttle, the thermoelectric modules will use the extra juice that the compressor doesn't need to provide additional cooling.\n\nSince Promethean was founded in 2007, it has built a laboratory-scale 60-liter chiller. Last week, the company secured funding with which it plans to build a 500-liter prototype that it hopes to test in India in 2009.\n\n\nThe company had toyed with the idea of using only thermoelectric modules hooked up to PV panels. In a thermoelectric module, voltage applied across a thermoelectric material sandwiched between two ceramic plates makes one side hot and the other cold. However, existing thermoelectrics (which are used in temperature-controlled car seats, lasers, and portable picnic coolers), typically bismuth or lead telluride, are not efficient enough for large refrigerators.\n\nGang Chen, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, says that the efficiency of a cooling unit depends on its size. \"As you shrink the size to a hotel refrigerator, the compressor itself becomes less efficient,\" he says. \"In those cases, thermoelectric becomes increasingly more attractive.\" Promethean's approach to combining thermoelectrics with compressors sounds like a logical argument to increase cooling efficiency in commercial-scale systems, Chen says.\n\nThe company's 60-liter prototype used bismuth-telluride modules from Dallas-based Marlow Industries. That is the most efficient cooling material known so far, says Boston College physics professor Zhifeng Ren. But there is still room for improvement, and Grama says that the company is on the lookout for new, possibly more-efficient materials.\n\nThe startup company might be in luck. Many advances in thermoelectric materials have come out of laboratories recently. MIT's Chen, for one, has increased the efficiency of bismuth antimony telluride by 40 percent by using nanocrystalline materials. Researchers are also tinkering with lead telluride and are starting to use silicon nanowires and silicon-germanium composites. Chen and Ren have founded a company called GMZ Energy, headquartered in Newton, MA, to commercialize their nanocomposite material, and they're expecting commercial thermoelectric modules within one year.\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Making Search Social\n\nA new engine can turn a difficult search into a communal quest.\n\nLooking for an apartment online, day after day, can get tedious. Finding the right sofa at the right price can also be time consuming. A new search engine, called Yotify, is designed to make these kinds of persistent quests more tolerable, and hopefully more successful.\n\nMuch like Google Alerts and Yahoo Alerts, a Yotify search does not start and end in an instant. Instead, the search runs at regular intervals--either hourly or daily, depending on the user's preference--with results sent back to the user via e-mail.\n\nBut Yotify offers much more than the search giants' current alert tools, argues Ron Bouganim, CEO and cofounder of Branchnext, the San Francisco startup behind Yotify. Those alert tools, Bouganim says, are merely an afterthought for these huge companies, and they do not take into account important Web 2.0 developments, such as social networking.\n\n\"We want to create a richer experience,\" Bouganim says.\n\nWhen users sign up for an account, they are given a personal profile page that lists, stores, and displays what they've searched for and where. That information can be made public as well, so that friends can share the results and help refine the search. This could be particularly useful for group projects such as apartment hunting with roommates, for example.\n\nMeanwhile, Yotify is making it a point to closely integrate with the major social-networking sites, most notably Facebook and LinkedIn. \"If people want to search through Facebook using our technology, we want to let them do it,\" claims Bouganim.\n\nAnother distinguishing characteristic of Yotify versus Google Alerts or Yahoo Alerts is its focus on shopping. Whereas Google Alerts is primarily concerned with retrieving news and other hard information, Yotify is setting up as more of a sales tool for its partner sites, which include general retailers such as Shopping.com as well as a host of niche players.\n\nIn this respect, Yotify does go above and beyond what Google Alerts currently provides. Say a user wants to buy a black futon, for example. The important aspect of the search is not that the user obtain the futon immediately, but that it's a certain price. Yotify will continually monitor its partner sites, then notify the user when a black futon is available at that particular price.\n\nThe main problem with Yotify is that, as of now, it only scans a small portion of the Web: users can only search among Yotify's partner sites. While the search engine has partnered with many key websites, such as Craigslist, the New York Times, and eBay, it certainly does not have the breadth of a search giant such as Google or Yahoo. \n\nThe technology involved is quite different than the large-scale indexing done by a typical search engine. Yotify asks partner sites to integrate its software into their systems. \"We don't 'scrape' information from other sites,\" explains Bouganim. \"We help other sites distribute their information in a way that fully complies with the goals of the partner site.\"\n\nFrom the user perspective, however, all that matters is the effectiveness of the search. And a user who has no idea where to find what he is looking for won't want to follow the Yotify format and select specific blogs or news sites for the search.\n\nBouganim claims that this \"deep but narrow\" issue will be resolved in future releases--and sooner rather than later. Indeed, it's still early days for the search engine; a test version of the tool was just launched on September 24.\n\nOnline media analyst Mike Boland of The Kelsey Group notes that getting users to switch from Google to a different engine could prove difficult, no matter what innovations Yotify attempts. \"It is such an uphill battle to get users to break out of deep-rooted online habits,\" Boland says. \"Companies that have spent too much time drinking the Kool-Aid seem to forget that, because they think their solution is so great that it will overcome this issue. But it usually doesn't.\"\n\nAlthough unwilling to get into details about the business model, Bouganim is clearly planning to exploit the social-networking and e-commerce aspects of Yotify. \"Understanding people's wants and needs, as well as those of their friends, obviously has a tremendous amount of value.\" \n" .

Borrowers falling behind on their payments. Defaults rising. Huge swaths of loans souring. Investors getting burned. But forget the now-familiar tales of mortgages gone bad. The next horror for beaten-down financial firms is the $950 billion worth of outstanding credit-card debt—much of it toxic.\n\nThat's bad news for players like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) that have largely sidestepped—and even benefited from—the mortgage mess but have major credit-card operations. They're hardly alone. The consumer debt bomb is already beginning to spray shrapnel throughout the financial markets, further weakening the U.S. economy. \"The next meltdown will be in credit cards,\" says Gregory Larkin, senior analyst at research firm Innovest Strategic Value Advisors. Adds William Black, senior vice-president of Moody's Investors Service's structured finance team: \"We still haven't hit the post-recessionary peaks [in credit-card losses], so things will get worse before they get better.\" What's more, the U.S. Treasury Dept.'s $700 billion mortgage bailout won't be a lifeline for credit-card issuers.\n\nThe big firms say they're prepared for the storm. Early last year JPMorgan started reaching out to troubled borrowers, setting up payment programs and making other adjustments to accounts. \"We have seen higher credit-card losses,\" acknowledges JPMorgan spokeswoman Tanya M. Madison. \"We are concerned about [it] but believe we are taking the right steps to help our customers and manage our risk.\"\n\nBut some banks and credit-card companies may be exacerbating their problems. To boost profits and get ahead of coming regulation, they're hiking interest rates. But that's making it harder for consumers to keep up. That'll only make tomorrow's pain worse. Innovest estimates that credit-card issuers will take a $41 billion hit from rotten debt this year and a $96 billion blow in 2009.\n\nThose losses, in turn, will wend their way through the $365 billion market for securities backed by credit-card debt. As with mortgages, banks bundle groups of so-called credit-card receivables, essentially consumers' outstanding balances, and sell them to big investors such as hedge funds and pension funds. Big issuers offload roughly 70% of their credit-card debt.\n\nBut it's getting harder for banks to find buyers for that debt. Interest rates have been rising on credit-card securities, a sign that investor appetite is waning. To help entice buyers, credit-card companies are having to put up more money as collateral, a guarantee in case something goes wrong with the securities. Mortgage lenders, in sharp contrast, typically aren't asked to do this—at least not yet. With consumers so shaky, now isn't a good time to put more skin in the game. \"Costs will go up for issuers,\" warns Dennis Moroney of the consultancy Tower Group.\n\nSure, the credit-card market is just a fraction of the $11.9 trillion mortgage market. But sometimes the losses can be more painful. That's because most credit-card debt is unsecured, meaning consumers don't have to make down payments when opening up their accounts. If they stop making monthly payments and the account goes bad, there are no underlying assets for credit-card companies to recoup. With mortgages, in contrast, some banks are protected both by down payments and by the ability to recover at least some of the money by selling the property.\nTHE BIG BOYS' BURDEN\n\nMaking matters worse, the subprime threat is also greater in credit-card land. Risky borrowers with low credit scores account for roughly 30% of outstanding credit-card debt, compared with 11% of mortgage debt. More than 45% of Washington Mutual's credit-card portfolio is subprime, according to Innovest. That could become a headache for JPMorgan Chase, which agreed on Sept. 25 to buy the troubled thrift's credit-card business and other assets for $1.9 billion. Says a JPMorgan spokeswoman: \" \n" .

        nif:isString    "Purifying Water with Nano-particles \n\nAdding nanoparticles to a water purifying membrane can double its efficiency, according to a startup company based in Los Angeles. With global water usage on the increase and fresh water in limited supply, the company, NanoH2O, says its novel approach could make such purification technology a viable solution to a growing problem.\n\nReverse osmosis--feeding water through a semipermeable membrane to filter out impurities--is widely considered to be the most effective way to desalinate water. But it is very energy-intensive, and therefore expensive, because water has to be forced through the membrane under pressure. A key way to reduce the costs involved is to increase the water throughput for the same pressure. But for many years, improvements in membrane technology have been incremental at best, says Jeff Green, NanoH2O founder and CEO.\n\nNanoH2O has found that adding porous nanoparticles to membranes can dramatically increase the efficiency with which water can be filtered. \"Under similar pressure, twice as much water goes through,\" says Green. In a desalination plant, this increased permeability would reduce energy requirements by 20 percent, or increase water productivity by 70 percent for the same cost, he adds.\n\n\"The concept is good,\" says Benito Mariñas, an environmental engineer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Membrane-based desalination is usually considered only when freshwater supplies fail to meet demand. But with demand on the increase and only 1 percent of global freshwater available for human use, Mariñas says such technologies will become more important. \"Right now we are not using membranes for sea water desalination as much as we could,\" he says, largely due to the amount of energy required.\n\nThe material used for reverse osmosis is usually an organic thin-film membrane, typically a polymide material perforated with tiny holes. These holes are small enough to let water pass through, but they block salt and other contaminants. NanoH2O's approach, based on research carried out by Eric Hoek, an environmental engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles, is to embed cage-like nanoparticles made out of aluminosilicate minerals, called zeolites, into the membrane. These particles have a diameter of no more than 200 nanometres--roughly equivalent to the thickness of the membrane.\n\nEmbedding the nanoparticles changes the properties of the membrane, making it hydrophilic, or water-attracting, so that water passes through more easily. Crucially, however, the membrane retains its ability to filter out contaminants, Green says.\n\nNanoH2O has been in a research phase since the company was set up in 2005. But earlier this month, it secured $15 million in funding to commercialize its technology. According to Green, the company will now scale up production with the aim of bringing its technology to market by 2010.\n\nMariñas says there's been plenty of interest in using inorganic hydrophilic materials for reverse osmosis, but no other design has been commercialized. One reason for this, he says, is that most hydrophilic materials tend to be bad at filtering out impurities. \"The fact that this company is producing a hybrid that's not made exclusively out of hydrophilic material is very interesting,\" he says.\n\nAnother key advantage, says Green, is that the nanoparticles developed by NanoH2O have a three-dimensional porous structure. This means that unlike some other porous hydrophilic materials being investigated, there is no need to worry about how they are oriented within the membrane in order to pass water.\n\nNanoH2O's embedded approach is also compatible with existing manufacturing processes, Green says, adding just 5 percent to production costs. \n" .

        nif:isString    "Ever since the discovery that a pregnant woman's blood contains traces of her baby's DNA, researchers have been looking for ways to screen that DNA for genetic abnormalities. A new test developed by Stephen Quake and his colleagues at Stanford University takes us one step closer to a noninvasive blood test to diagnose disorders like Down syndrome in a fetus.\n\nThe new test uses powerful DNA sequencing techniques to amplify short fragments of a baby's DNA from its mother's blood, and to map the chromosomes. The method reveals the extra copies of chromosomes--aneuploidy--characteristic of certain genetic disorders, including Down syndrome, in which there are three copies of chromosome 21 rather than two.\n\n\"Now we're getting closer to the time when there will be not a screening test but a definitive noninvasive test,\" says Joe Leigh Simpson of Florida International University. Simpson wasn't involved in Quake's work.\n\nThe test picked up all nine cases of Down syndrome among 18 women in a study reported today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It also detected two cases of Edward syndrome, in which there is an extra copy of chromosome 18, and one instance of Patau syndrome, characterized by three copies of chromosome 13.\n\n\"This is very exciting,\" says Farideh Bischoff, a cytogeneticist with Biocept, a biotech company based in San Diego. \"It's powerful.\" Bischoff wasn't involved in Quake's work.\n\nCurrently, the gold standard for prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome is amniocentesis, \"which requires a big needle to be stuck into the mom right next to the baby\" to extract a sample of amniotic fluid, explains Quake, who is also an investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. There's an attendant risk of miscarriage, infection, or damage to the fetus. A diagnosis may also be made by chorionic villus sampling, which uses tissue from the placenta but has a higher risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis. The samples of amniotic fluid or placenta are examined to see if the fetus has three copies of chromosome 21.\n\nQuake's technique takes advantage of the fact that small amounts of DNA from a fetus circulate in its mother's blood. Some DNA is within intact fetal cells, but about a decade ago, researchers discovered that a pregnant woman's blood also carries free-floating fetal DNA. Unlike intact cells, cell-free fetal DNA doesn't linger from one pregnancy to another. It's also more abundant than that from intact cells, but still rare enough to make it difficult to detect. \n\nQuake and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women who were considered at high risk of carrying a baby with aneuploidy and used high-throughput sequencing to amplify fragments of DNA from both the mother and fetus and to map its chromosomes. They then looked at the amount of material from each chromosome. An overabundance of any particular chromosome pointed to a genetic disorder. The results, Quake says, \"can be as precise as you want simply by sequencing more fragments.\"\n\n\"It's a step forward,\" adds James Egan, chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Connecticut Health Center. \"It has great potential, but it's not ready for prime time yet.\" Egan did not contribute to the Stanford study. Quake's team is now planning a larger study of several hundred pregnant women.\n\nThe cost of the sequencing used in the study was $700 per sample, but Quake says that it has since slipped to $300, as the cost of the technology continues to drop. \"If it truly can be performed for $700, it could revolutionize the field,\" Simpson says.\n\nQuake's team tested women in their second trimester of pregnancy, although he believes that the test could be used as early as 10 weeks into a pregnancy. A first-trimester test for Down syndrome would be preferable, so that parents have more time to decide if they wish to terminate the pregnancy, or to prepare for the birth of a baby with the disorder.\n\nQuake's method is one of several different approaches to the problem of using fetal DNA in a noninvasive diagnostic test for genetic disorders like Down syndrome.\n\nSequenom, based in San Diego, is developing a test based on genes on chromosome 21 that code for fetal-specific RNA. Those markers can be used to count copies of the chromosome.\"There are thousands of genetic disorders that can easily be diagnosed with genetic screening,\" says Ravinder Dhallan, founder and CEO of Ravgen, a Columbia, MD-based biotech company that's developing diagnostic tests using fetal DNA. \"Some are treatable today and many more may be treatable in the future.\n\nIt's not yet clear which method--or methods--will ultimately pay off. \"It's like CDs or DVDs or thumb drives,\" says the University of Connecticut's Egan. \"They're all different ways of approaching a problem. One or all will catch the imagination of the medical community and become a very useful clinical tool.\"\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Sialkot will be the unknown package\nSialkot Stallions could well be the team to watch out for in the Champions League T20 to be played in India this year.\nIt was the story of the city rat versus the village rat. It was the story of Shahid Afridi versus Shoaib Malik. It was the story of Karachi Dolphins versus the Sialkot Stallions. In the fitness of things, Malik's Sialkot triumphed in the final of the Pakistan T20 championship in Lahore, last week.\n\nI am not surprised by the result. For many of you who do not follow Pakistan cricket, this has been Sialkot's hattrick of T20 titles and I am happy, Malik led from the front. Malik has been under a lot of pressure of late. Last Wednesday night at Gaddafi, Sialkot rode a fine all-round show from their captain (2 for 29 and 19 not out off 23 balls). Hopefully, this will stop the debate on who should lead Pakistan in Tests and ODIs. Malik is relatively consistent and a big stage performer.\n\nSialkot's win once again enforces my view that there is a whole lot of talent waiting to be tapped in our smaller towns. Watch out for this boy Adeel Malik. His unbeaten 23 off 11 balls hastened Sialkot's comprehensive 7-wicket win. And I am sure there are many like Adeel who want to rise through the ranks. The ‘big' town lads in both India and Pakistan are too busy these days. There are too many distractions. The ‘small' town lads are making an impact. Sialkot is a glaring example.\n\nNow comes the big stage: Champions League. I think Sialkot will be worthy representatives of Pakistan. They will surely be the underdogs, but don't count them out. An unknown team is always dangerous and Sialkot have the ingredients to explode on a big day. More than anything else, Sialkot will truly be a Pakistani outfit. Unlike the two Indian teams peppered with foreigners, Sialkot will play for national pride as well.\n\nIt's silly to pick a Champions League favourite. In 20-20 cricket, there is a no clear favourite. But yes, the Indian teams, Rajasthan and Chennai, will have an edge because they will play in front of home crowds.\n\nOur T20 championship was a great success. People thronged the stadiums to watch the games. There were no security issues and cricket was enjoyed the way it should be. Australia and the West Indies, are you listening?\n\nFormer Pakistan Test captain Wasim Akram is an ESPN-STAR expert\n" .

        nif:isString    " Colon Cancer Screening, The Easy Way\n\n\n  A new software program promises to make one of medicine's more grimace-inducing checkups significantly simpler. By devising a way to digitally clean up three-dimensional X-ray images of the colon, a group of researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook hope to encourage more patients to receive their recommended colon cancer screenings.\n\nColorectal cancer kills close to 700 000 people each year worldwide—a staggering number considering that most of these victims are done in by a tumor that ticks like a time bomb for as long as 15 years before erupting. This easily foiled killer creeps up on so many people because the gold standard in colorectal cancer detection, the colonoscopy, is tremendously unpopular. The prescreening regimen requires ingesting nothing but liquids for 24 hours, including a diarrhea-inducing concoction that forces a patient to stay near the bathroom for hours. Then there's the test itself: a camera attached to a fiber-optic cable is inserted into a patient's rear and snaked through the colon. This allows a doctor to visually inspect the walls of the gut for the presence of polyps that could turn cancerous.\n\nFor the past few years, the option of a virtual colonoscopy has offered patients a partial reprieve by doing away with the inserted camera. Instead, a computed tomography (CT) scan renders a 3-D image of the colon, enabling doctors to perform noninvasive virtual fly-throughs of patients' digestive tracts. But recipients have still had to deal with the discomforting effects of the prescreening potion and diet. Now these researchers hope their method—partial volume segmentation, described in an upcoming article in IEEE Transactions in Biomedical Engineering—will banish that as well.\n\nTheir algorithm, an improvement on a technique devel
