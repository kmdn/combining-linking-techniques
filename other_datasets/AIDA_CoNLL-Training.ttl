        nif:isString    "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb. Peter Blackburn BRUSSELS 1996-08-22 The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep. Germany's representative to the European Union's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer. \"We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it,\" the Commission's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing. He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union. He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health. Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-- mad cow disease. But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU's standing veterinary committee, mational animal health officials, questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health. Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through \"dangerous generalisation.\". Only France and Britain backed Fischler's proposal. The EU's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials. Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie, a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste. British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep, but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe. \"What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany's lead,\" Welsh National Farmers ' Union (NFU) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio. Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef. Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year, nearly half of total imports. It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton, some 10 percent of overall imports." .

LONDON 1996-08-22 A rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S. guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $ 17,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician's favourite possessions. A Florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ($ 16,935) for the draft of \"Ai n't no telling\", which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966. At the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience, where it was retrieved by a fan. Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, who lived with him from 1966 to 1969. They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs, which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ($ 7,845). The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27." .

Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : \"The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities.\" State media quoted China's top negotiator with Taipei, Tang Shubei, as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks. \"Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks... that is to end the state of hostility,\" Thursday's overseas edition of the People's Daily quoted Tang as saying. The foreign ministry's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. China, which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition, was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien." .

FRANKFURT 1996-08-22 German first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in July this year from the year-earlier period, the Federal office for motor vehicles said on Thursday. The office said 356,725 new cars were registered in July 1996-- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks. The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995. Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period. The growth was partly due to an increased number of Germans buying German cars abroad, while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak, the federal office said. Almost all German car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period. Volkswagen AG won 77,719 registrations, slightly more than a quarter of the total. Opel AG together with General Motors came in second place with 49,269 registrations, 16.4 percent of the overall figure. Third was Ford with 35,563 registrations, or 11.7 percent. Only Seat and Porsche had fewer registrations in July 1996 compared to last year's July. Seat posted 3,420 registrations compared with 5522 registrations in July a year earlier. Porsche's registrations fell to 554 from 643." .

Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 Israel's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup. Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israel's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria, told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight. \"It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate. The Syrians are confused, they are definitely tense, but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup,\" he said. Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador. He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician. Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere. Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile. It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes. \"The message that we sent to (Syrian President Hafez al-) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations,\" Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview. Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions. Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February. \"The voices coming out of Damascus are bad, not good. The media... are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying... this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners,\" Levy said. \"We expect from Syria, if its face is to peace, that it will answer Israel's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal,\" he said. \"We do not want a war, God forbid. No one benefits from wars.\" Israel's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a \"calming signal\" to Israel. It gave no source for the report. Netanyahu and Levy's spokesmen said they could not confirm it. The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo, the United States and Moscow." .

Hassan Hafidh BAGHDAD 1996-08-22 An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month. A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran's rebel Kurds. \"Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan,\" it said. A spokesman for the group said the meeting \"signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions\". Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad. Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) group. PUK and Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions, have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War. Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year. Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in Qasri region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days. It said about 100 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack. Both Iran and Turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern Iraq in pursuit of their own Kurdish rebels. A U.S.-led air force in southern Turkey protects Iraqi Kurds from possible attacks by Baghdad troops." .

Arafat had been scheduled to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday but the venue was changed to Gaza after Israel denied flight clearance to the Palestinian leader's helicopters. Palestinian officials accused right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to stop the Ramallah meeting by keeping Arafat grounded. Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials, on civilian affairs, at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank. Abu Rdainah said Arafat had decided against flying to the West Bank on Thursday, after Israel lifted the ban, because he had a busy schedule in Gaza and would not be free until Monday." .

JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 Yasser Arafat will meet Shimon Peres in Gaza on Thursday after Palestinians said the right-wing Israeli government had barred the Palestinian leader from flying to the West Bank for talks with the former prime minister. \"The meeting between Peres and Arafat will take place at Erez checkpoint in Gaza and not in Ramallah as planned,\" Peres ' office said. Palestinian officials said the Israeli government had barred Arafat from overflying Israel in a Palestinian helicopter to the West Bank in an attempt to bar the meeting with Peres. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused opposition leader Peres, who he defeated in May elections, of trying to undermine his Likud government's authority to conduct peace talks." .

Hilary Gush DUBAI 1996-08-22 Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days, the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday. \"Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry. Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days,\" an embassy official said. \"The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland. There is no objection to their travel,\" he added. The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent, possibly last Tuesday. It has since been silent on the issue. When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul, the embassy official said : \"That has not been decided, but possibly Kandahar.\" Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia. Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government, which Taleban is fighting to overthrow. The embassy official said the three men, believed to be in their 20s, were currently in Abu Dhabi. He did not elaborate. The Russians, working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan, were taken hostage after a Taleban MiG-19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 1995. Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani's government. Moscow said the crew's nationality was coincidental. Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed. The Russians, who said they overpowered the guards-- two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles-- while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin 76 cargo plane last Friday, left the UAE capital Abu Dhabi for home on Sunday." .

Zhirinovsky said on Tuesday he would press the Russian government to help end U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq and blamed Moscow for delaying establishment of good ties with Baghdad. \"Our stand is firm, namely we are calling on (the Russian) government to end the economic embargo on Iraq and resume trade ties between Russia and Iraq,\" he told reporters. Zhirinovsky visited Iraq twice in 1995. Last October he was invited to attend the referendum held on Iraq's presidency, which extended Saddam's term for seven more years." .

BONN 1996-08-22 Germany's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals. \"Until this is cleared up by the European Union's scientific panels-- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible-- (consumers) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries,\" ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television. \"I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers,\" he added. \"There are too many holes in what we know, and these must be filled very quickly.\" Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis, which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef. The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified. EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-- mad cow disease. But some members of the EU's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health. The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees. Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste. British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat. ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year, nearly half of total imports. It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton, some 10 percent of overall imports. After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent, the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports. EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease." .

YORK, England 1996-08-22 Sir Mark Prescott landed his first group one victory in 25 years as a trainer when his top sprinter Pivotal, a 100-30 chance, won the Nunthorpe Stakes on Thursday. The three-year-old, partnered by veteran George Duffield, snatched a short head verdict in the last stride to deny Eveningperformance (16-1), trained by Henry Candy and ridden by Chris Rutter. Hever Golf Rose (11-4), last year's Prix de l ' Abbaye winner at Longchamp, finished third, a further one and a quarter lengths away with the 7-4 favourite Mind Games in fourth. Pivotal, a Royal Ascot winner in June, may now be aimed at this season's Abbaye, Europe's top sprint race. Prescott, reluctant to go into the winner's enclosure until the result of the photo-finish was announced, said : \"Twenty-five years and I have never been there so I thought I had better wait a bit longer.\" He added : \"It's very sad to beat Henry Candy because I am godfather to his daughter.\" Like Prescott, Jack Berry, trainer of Mind Games, had gone into Thursday's race in search of a first group one success after many years around the top of his profession. Berry said : \"I`m disappointed but I do n't feel suicidal. He (Mind Games) was going as well as any of them one and a half furlongs (300 metres) out but he just did n't quicken.\"" .

Blackburn announced on Wednesday they and Dalglish had parted by mutual consent. But the ex-manager confessed on Thursday to being \"sad\" at leaving after taking Blackburn from the second division to the premier league title inside three and a half years. In a telephone call to a local newspaper from his holiday home in Spain, Dalglish said : \"We came to the same opinion, albeit the club came to it a little bit earlier than me.\" He added : \"If no one asked, I never opened my mouth. I have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job. The club thought it (the job) had run its course and I came to the same conclusion.\" Dalglish had been with Blackburn for nearly five years, first as manager and then, for the past 15 months, as director of football." .
