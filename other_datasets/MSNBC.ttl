        nif:isString    "Hindus throng to Ganges for bathing festival \nPilgrims believe dip in river during six week celebration will cleanse sin \n \nALLAHABAD, India - Nearly half a million Hindus braved near-freezing temperatures to wash away their sins in the icy waters of the Ganges river in northern India on Wednesday, the first day of a six-week festival. \n \nAs many as 70 million people from India and abroad are expected over the whole “Ardh Kumbh Mela” or Half Pitcher Festival, billed as one of the largest gatherings on earth. \n \nMen, women, children, holy men in saffron and the infirm gathered at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and a mythical third river in Allahabad city well before dawn, waiting for the sun to rise for the auspicious bath on the first day of the 42-day event. \n \nThey chanted verses from Hindu scriptures and sang holy songs as they walked towards the bathing areas, some lying prostrate after every few steps to salute the gods. \n \nThe festival falls midway between the “Maha Kumbh Mela” or the Great Pitcher Festival, celebrated once every 12 years. \n \nHindus believe that bathing in the Ganges during the festivals cleanses them of sin, speeding the way to the attainment of nirvana or the afterlife. \n \n'Like being with God' \n \nAfter dipping in the polluted but sacred waters, many filled cans, bottles and steel containers for relatives and friends who could not make it. Others sprinkled it on their dry clothes.  \n \n“It was a long-cherished desire to take a dip here during the Kumbh Mela,” said Naba Kumar Ghosh, a young school teacher from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. “The experience has been one of fulfillment, a complete cleansing of the inner self.” \n \nShakuntala, a 70-year-old woman who gave only one name, said she traveled all night from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to bathe in the Ganges, just as she has done at every Kumbh Mela over the last 25 years. \n \n“It was a divine experience, a dip in the holy waters is like being with God,” she said. “God willing, I will be here for the next 'Kumbh' too”. \n \nRama Devi, an old woman from Allahabad who could not remember her age, has not missed a single Kumbh and was determined to make it this time despite her inability to walk. \n \nWith roads closed to traffic, her 35-year-old son, a soldier in the Indian army, carried her on his back for the 6-mile walk from their house to the waters. \n \nTight security \nAllahabad, in the Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh, is one of four spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested during a titanic battle with demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality. \n \nGaruda’s flight lasted 12 divine days, or 12 years of mortal time, hence the celebration of “Maha Kumbh Mela” every 12 years. \n \nThe midway point between two such celebrations is also considered highly favorable because the position of the sun and the moon are the same as during the “Maha Kumbh”. \n \nThe “Maha Kumbh Mela” in 1989 attracted 15 million pilgrims and the Guinness Book of Records dubbed it the largest gathering of human beings for a single purpose. The festival in 2001 drew between 50 and 70 million. \n \nThousands of tents and camps have been built to house pilgrims across the 4,000 acre  festival area and more than 10,000 policemen, including specially-trained “terrorist spotters”, have been deployed, authorities said. \n \n\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Stocks start new trading year with rally \nMarket indexes surge after Home Depot chief executive quits \n \nNEW YORK - Stocks moved soundly higher in the first session of 2007 as investors cheered mostly solid readings on the economy and found reason for increased prospects for big-name retailers Home Depot Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \n \nA decline in oil prices added to the strong sentiment that at times drove the Dow Jones industrials to a new trading high. \n \nStocks, which had surged from the start on word that Home Depot’s chairman and chief executive had resigned after years of lackluster performance in the company’s stock, added to their gains after Wall Street received a stronger-than-expected report on December manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management and saw a softer-than-expected decline in construction spending. \n \n“The ISM number was better than expected and construction fell less than expected,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards. “I think those of us looking for a soft landing had more support on that stance today.” \n \nIn early afternoon trading, the Dow surged 96.53, or 0.77 percent, to 12,559.68 after jumping earlier to a new trading high of 12,580.35. \n \nBroader stock indicators also rose, with the Nasdaq composite index especially showing sharp gains. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was up 7.94, or 0.56 percent, at 1,426.24, and the tech-laden Nasdaq rose 32.92, or 1.36 percent, to 2,448.21. \n \nBonds rose but retreated from an earlier big advance; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.68 percent from 4.71 percent late Friday. Bond investors were trying to balance the ISM news with a weak employment report from a division of payroll company Automatic Data Processing Inc. ADP said private sector employment fell by 40,000 in December following three months of gains that averaged 121,000 per month; investors theorized that the report might improve the chances for an interest rate cut in the early part of the year. \n \nThe dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell. \n \nLight, sweet crude fell $2.44 to $58.61 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as mild weather continued its hold over much of the United States, cutting demand for heating oil and natural gas. \n \nWith markets closed Tuesday to mark the funeral of President Gerald R. Ford, Wall Street returned from its longest hiatus — four days — since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shortly after they returned to work, investors received word that the ISM index came in at 51.4, stronger than the reading of 50 that had been expected. A reading above 50 signals expansion in the manufacturing sector; November’s figure of 49.5 marked the first time the report showed contraction in nearly four years. \n \nAlso giving a boost to stocks, construction spending dropped by a less-than-expected 0.2 percent in November as housing activity fell for a record eighth straight month. The Commerce Department reported that building activity edged down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.18 trillion. \n \n“Basically, we’re still in an up market even though it’s 51 months old,” Goldman said. “This is still a market that has good upside momentum.” \n \nNews that Bob Nardelli resigned from the world’s largest home improvement chain added to positive investor sentiment from a weekend report that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s December same-store sales rose 1.6 percent, topping the company’s forecast that growth would be flat or up as much as 1 percent. Home Depot rose $1.35, or 3.4 to $41.51, while Wal-Mart advanced $1.53, or 3.3 percent, to $47.71. \n \nIn corporate news, Cytokinetics Inc. surged $1.05, or 14 percent, to $8.53 on news it would work with Amgen Inc. to develop drugs to combat heart failure. Amgen rose 72 cents to $69.03. \n \nSirius Satellite Radio Inc. rose 27 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $3.81 after the radio service said its subscriber base jumped 82 percent to more than 6 million last year. \n \nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. advanced $1.79, or 8.5 percent, to $22.78 and moved as high as $22.77 to surpass a 52-week high of $21.35 after a three-month strike that had hurt production ended. \n \nHome builders were weaker after Lennar Corp., the biggest U.S. builder, warned that it expects to post a loss in the fourth quarter and its chief executive said he see no signs of a recovery in the housing market. Lennar fell $1.40, or 2.7 percent, to $51.06. \n \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.13 billion shares, compared with 430.7 million traded at the same point Friday, a day of anemic volume ahead of the New Year’s holiday. \n \nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 5.96, or 0.76 percent, at 793.62. \n \nOverseas, Japan’s Nikkei stock average rose 0.01 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 closed up 0.13 percent, Germany’s DAX index was up 0.15 percent, and France’s CAC-40 was down 0.12 percent. \n\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Mourners in Michigan welcome body of Ford  \nEx-president 'who meant so much' scheduled to be buried Wednesday \n \nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - Moving quietly and solemnly through the moonlight, mourners waited for a chance to file past the casket of Gerald R. Ford, welcoming home the 38th president for a final time and celebrating a man they said embodied Midwest values. \n \n“This is a once-in-lifetime opportunity to pay tribute,” said Karin Lewis, 44, who brought her five boys, ages 6 to 15, to Ford’s presidential museum to pay respects Tuesday night. “He meant so much to this community.” \n \nFord’s state funeral was to end Wednesday afternoon after a service at Grace Episcopal Church in East Grand Rapids. His body was to be interred during a private burial overlooking the Grand River north of the museum on the museum grounds. \n \nDonald Rumsfeld, who served in Ford’s cabinet as his chief of staff and as his defense secretary, was to deliver a eulogy. Former President Jimmy Carter, who defeated Ford in 1976 but later became a close friend of his former opponent, and Richard Norton Smith, who used to be the director of the Ford museum and presidential library, also were scheduled to speak. \n \nFinal salute \nOn Tuesday, members of the public jammed streets and waved as Ford’s casket was carried from the Grand Rapids airport, where it arrived following services at Washington National Cathedral. \n \n“You were a paradoxical gift of remarkable intellect and achievement wrapped in a plain brown wrapper,” Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said of Ford. “Welcome home to the people that you reflected so well when you were in Washington.” \n \nLater, members of the public walked from the DeVos Place convention center across a bridge over the Grand River to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum for a final salute. \n \nSome wore formal suits and dresses. Others wore sweat shirts from University of Michigan, where Ford played center on the Wolverines’ undefeated national championship football teams of 1932 and 1933. \n \n“I grew up in Grand Rapids, and President Ford was our legacy,” said Bobbe Taber, 43, who now lives in the Kalamazoo area but came to Grand Rapids to see Ford’s casket. \n \nMichigan National Guard spokeswoman Lynn Chapp said 60,000 people were expected to walk by the casket from the time repose began around 6 p.m. Tuesday until it was scheduled to end at 11 a.m. Wednesday. Lines snaked along several blocks in the city’s downtown as people waited their turn Tuesday night. \n \n'The best of America' \nThe service Wednesday at his hometown church, which seats about 350, was to be much smaller than Tuesday’s elaborate national funeral service in Washington, which drew 3,000 people. President Bush and his father spoke Tuesday, as did NBC newsman Tom Brokaw and Ford’s secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, among others. \n \n“In President Ford, the world saw the best of America, and America found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nation’s history,” President Bush said in his eulogy. \n \nBush’s father, the first President Bush, called Ford a “Norman Rockwell painting come to life” and pierced the solemnity of the occasion by cracking gentle jokes about Ford’s reputation as an errant golfer. He said Ford knew his golf game was getting better when he began hitting fewer spectators. \n \nUnder towering arches of the cathedral, Kissinger paid tribute to Ford’s leadership in achieving nuclear arms control with the Soviets, pushing for the first political agreement between Israel and Egypt and helping to bring majority rule to southern Africa. \n \n“In his understated way he did his duty as a leader, not as a performer playing to the gallery,” Kissinger said. “Gerald Ford had the virtues of small town America.” \n \nBrokaw said in his eulogy that Ford brought to office “no demons, no hidden agenda, no hit list or acts of vengeance,” an oblique reference to the air of subterfuge that surrounded Nixon in his final days. \n \nFord’s athletic interest was honored, too, in the capital and in Michigan. At the Grand Rapids airport that bears Ford’s name, the University of Michigan band played the school’s famous fight song, “The Victors,” as Ford’s flag-draped casket was transferred to a hearse. \n \nFord died at 93 on Dec. 26 at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. \n\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Health insurance bridges gap for poor families \nFree medical care can help children get out of poverty, official says \n \nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. - For years, Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help. \n \nRohling, who directed Alabama’s housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health? \n \n“Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty,” said Rohling. \n \nRohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation, which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider. \n \nThe foundation is just one example of a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid — subsidized insurance — for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it, or by an employer. \n \nThat gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States, a nation with no universal health care. Many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children. \n \n“The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,” and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank. \n \nTolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year. \n \nIn the lurch \nChildren with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost. \n \nThen the child’s illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health. \n \nIn Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs. \n \nJody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address. \n \nShe and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana’s brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma. \n \nBut Sharp’s husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance. \n \n“If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it’s thousands of dollars just like that,” Sharp told Reuters. \n \nDuring their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp’s children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance. \n \nSome 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months. \n \n“All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don’t have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,” said Sharp. \n \nBear's eye \nTo recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere. \n \nAt one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child’s ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don’t have health insurance. \n \nLow cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program. \n \n“There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work,” said spokesperson Denise Grabner of Highmark. \n \nIn 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when Congress enacted the SCHIP providing some matching funding. \n \nAlabama was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for Medicaid. \n \nMany states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But Rohling said an individual needed to earn nearly three times the poverty level to afford private insurance. \n \n“We fill the void between affordability and eligibility.” \n\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Evolving presidential preferences \nHow will American voters compensate in the next search for a president? \n \nWASHINGTON - Now that the 38th president has been laid to rest, the capital can take up the main business of 2007: trying to figure out who will be the 44th.  What type of leader does the country want? Here is my sense of it, based on talking to politicians, strategists and voters here and around the nation. \n \nNo ideologues, please \nThere was a time when President George W. Bush’s ideological certitude was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary. That time has long since passed. The country is tired, even fearful, of leaders with fervent beliefs that seem impervious to new (or even old) facts. Voters see the war in Iraq as an “idea,” not a solution – and Americans do not like ideas that do not work.  Voters likely will view Bush’s “surge” of troops into Iraq as new evidence of failure, and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas. \n \nSerious student \nPresidential elections are a never-ending series of mid-course corrections. Voters look to compensate for the leadership weaknesses of the incumbent. An example comes from the life and career of Gerald Ford. In 1976, voters wanted a pure antidote to Richard Nixon’s paranoid megalomania. Once Ford pardoned Nixon, he could not be that candidate. Instead, Americans chose Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer who had never worked in Washington, and who promised never to lie to the American people. The counterpoint thinking continues. Voters in 2008 are going to want someone who prides himself (or herself) on spending time in the library – who has a hands-on curiosity about the details. \n \nWashington experience not necessary \nVoters these days not only do not value Washington experience – or any office-holding experience – it can make them suspicious. That is what strategists and polltakers for Sen. Evan Bayh found when they studied whether he should run for president. They found that his remarkably deep resume – the son of a senator, he was the “boy governor” of Indiana before going to the Senate – was as handicap. Americans always are dubious about the capital, but that sentiment seems particularly strong. Bayh decided not to run. “`Washington’ doesn’t make the case,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who worked for Bayh. \n \nNo more boomer obsessions \nNot all elections are about change, but 2008 will be. Americans are moderately upbeat about the country’s prospects, but deeply worried about the world – and they have come to realize that they can’t separate one from the other. One thing for sure, says Pfeiffer, voters are tired of arguing about the culture of the 1960s and other Boomer issues.  “There is a sense that the 2004 election was too much about who did or did not do what in Vietnam,” said Pfeiffer, referring to the Bush campaign against Sen. John Kerry. In 2000, Bush won in part by selling himself as a “grown up” Boomer answer to Bill Clinton. “Voters are tired of that era and its concerns,” said Pfeiffer said. “They want to move on.” \n \nKnow the middle class \nBushes have a congenital family problem with this, and it leaves an opening for someone – of either party – who can prove that he or she really understands the strains of middle class life. It’s not just about money, but about cultural assaults and the lack of time for family in an era when both parents or partners need to work. In his forthcoming book, Positively American, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York imagines the hard life of a fictitious middle class family – and offers a series of governmental proposals to address them. A shrewd student of the American mood, Schumer is aiming in the right direction. The next president will need to show that he or she understands that family. \n\n\n" .

Have you broken it already? Don't despair. Nutritionist Joy Bauer has created 5 healthy, and simple, resolutions we all should have on our “to do” list for the new year: \n \nJoy's Healthy Resolutions for 2007: \n \n1. Make YOURSELF a priority \n*Shop for healthy foods your body needs \n*Get enough sleep \n*Exercise regularly \n \n2. Know your numbers \nRing in the New Year with a pledge to visit your doctor and learn your blood pressure reading and fasting cholesterol, triglyceride and blood sugar levels.  The sooner you know where you stand, the sooner you can take action to make corrections. \n \n*  Optimal blood pressure equal to or   120 / 80 mmHg \n*  Total cholesterol    200 mg/dL \n*  LDL-Cholesterol    100 mg/dL \n*  HDL-Cholesterol  40 mg/dL or higher \n*  Cholesterol ratio  below 5  \n*  Triglycerides    150 mg/dL \n*  Blood Sugars    100 mg/dL \n \n3. Up your ante!  \nAntioxidants are naturally occurring compounds found in plant based foods. Antioxidants help the body fight many serious conditions, including cancer and heart disease, by thwarting the action of harmful free radicals. According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, July 2006, the following foods are among the richest in antioxidants. Go out of your way to incorporate them into your daily diet. \n \n1. Blackberries \n2. Walnuts \n3. Strawberries \n4. Artichokes   \n5. Cranberries \n6. Raspberries \n7. Blueberries \n8. Cloves, ground \n \n4. Incorporate whole grains \n2007 is the year to stop buying refined, white starch. Instead, embrace brown rice, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread and other healthy grain varieties like millet, faro, and amaranth.  \n \nLearn how to buy the right bread! Many consumers believe they're buying the right type of bread but are often confused. According to a Sara Lee Food & Beverage survey, 73% of consumers who were asked what type of bread they had in the house said \"whole wheat bread,\" but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought \"enriched wheat\" meant whole grain. \n \nLook a \"whole\" lot closer at labels in the bread aisle - it must say 100% Whole Wheat or 100% Whole Grain, or list the word WHOLE as one of the first ingredients on the label. \n \n5.   Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist  \nIn an interesting experiment that was presented at the 2006 Annual Scientific Meeting a NAASO, women were invited to eat a pasta lunch on two different days. On one day, the women were given a small spoon and asked to take small bites, put the spoon down between bites, and chew each bite at least 15 times. On the second day, the women were given a large spoon and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites. On both occasions, the women ate until they felt comfortably full. When researchers measured how many calories the women ate, they found that women ate 67 more calories when they ate quickly than when they ate slowly. Although this may not sound like much, calories add up.  \n \nAn additional 134 calories per day, means 48,910 calories per year…. that's potentially 14 pounds (lost or gained!). \n \nFor more information on healthy eating, visit nutrition expert, Joy Bauer’s website at www.joybauernutrition.com  \n \n\n\n" .

Huizenga announced the departure at a news conference that Saban didn’t attend. \n \n“It is what it is,” Huizenga said, borrowing Saban’s pet phrase. “I’m not upset because it’s more involved than what you think.” \n \nSince late November, Saban had issued frequent, angry public denials of interest in moving to Tuscaloosa. Huizenga said the change of heart wasn’t driven by money, and Saban never sought a raise or contract extension. \n \nInstead, Huizenga hinted that family issues for Saban and his wife, Terry, were a factor. \n \n“I’ve been through this with Nick for quite some time now, and I feel the pain and so forth and so on of Nick and Terry, and it’s not a very simple thing,” Huizenga said. “I think Nick’s great. I’ll be Nick’s biggest fan. I’ll be cheering for him to win that bowl game.” \n \nA preference for the college game and the campus lifestyle may have swayed Saban. He won a national championship at LSU and is 15-17 with the Dolphins. This was his first losing season in 13 years as a head coach. \n \nThe Crimson Tide first approached Saban shortly after firing Mike Shula. Huizenga has said he received repeated assurances from Saban that he would return in 2007, and two weeks ago Saban said: “I’m not going to be the Alabama coach.” \n \nBut when the Dolphins’ 6-10 season ended Sunday, Alabama sweetened an offer that reportedly would make him the highest-paid coach in college football. He had three years remaining on his Miami contract at $4.5 million a year. \n \nIn the past, Huizenga has been persuasive when dealing with coaches. He talked Don Shula into retirement in 1996, talked Jimmy Johnson out of retiring three years later — Johnson lasted one more season — and was able to lure Saban to the pros in 2004 after other NFL teams had failed. \n \nBut this time, Huizenga failed to change Saban’s mind. \n \nAfter Saban turned down the Tide in early December, Alabama offered the job to Rich Rodriguez, but he decided to stay at West Virginia. Alabama lost last week to Oklahoma State in the Independence Bowl to finish 6-7. \n \nPossible candidates to replace Saban include Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera, former Green Bay head coach Mike Sherman, San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Cam Cameron, Indianapolis assistant Jim Caldwell, Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Norm Chow and Pittsburgh Steelers assistants Russ Grimm and Ken Whisenhut. \n \nHuizenga didn’t rule out hiring a college coach, as he did when Saban came to the Dolphins from LSU two years ago. \n \n“There’s only one thing I want to do, and it’s win,” Huizenga said. “I don’t care what it takes, what it costs, what’s involved, we’re going to make this a winning franchise. It’s no fun owning a team if you’re not winning, I can tell you that. And we are absolutely, positively going to get back to being a winning team. And sooner rather than later.” \n \nLeading the search for a coach will be Joe Bailey, chief executive officer of Dolphins Enterprises, and Brian Wiedmeier, the Dolphins’ president and chief operating officer. The Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons are also seeking a new coach. \n \nThe Dolphins’ next coach will be their fourth in nine seasons. \n \n“I wish you hadn’t brought that up,” Huizenga said with a wry smile. \n \nIt has been a frustrating a stretch of instability for a franchise that had the same coach — Shula — for 26 years. Miami has failed to make the playoffs the past five years, a team record. \n \nThe Dolphins are coming off their third losing season since 1969 and likely face a roster overhaul. With Daunte Culpepper struggling to recover from reconstructive knee surgery in 2005, Miami remains unsettled at quarterback, a troublesome position since Dan Marino retired seven years ago. The team needs upgrades in almost every other area for a feeble offense and aging defense. \n \nSaban leaves behind the NFL’s largest staff of assistants and general manager Randy Mueller, who might be given more responsibility under a new coaching regime. \n \nThe Dolphins haven’t reached the AFC championship game since Huizenga became majority owner in 1994. \n \n“All I want to figure out is how the heck we’re going to win,” he said. “And that’s what everyone with the Dolphins wants, to win. So win, win, win. That’s all I can say. We’re going to go out there and kick some butt and make something happen, I guarantee you.” \nNCAA \n\n\n" .

The report included large and small cities and their suburbs, along with U.S. territories. \n \nIn an overview, the report said all 75 areas surveyed have policies in place for helping their emergency workers communicate. But it cautioned that regular testing and exercises are needed \"to effectively link disparate systems.\" \n \nIt also said while cooperation among emergency workers is strong, \"formalized governance (leadership and planning) across regions has lagged.\" \n \nThe study, conducted by the Homeland Security Department, was likely to add fuel to what looms as a battle in Congress this year. Democrats, who take over the majority this week, have promised to try fixing the problem emergency agencies have communicating with each other but have not said specifically what they will do, how much it will cost or how they will pay for it. \n \n\"Five years after 9/11, we continue to turn a deaf ear to gaps in interoperable communications,\" the term used for emergency agencies' abilities to talk to each other, said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. \"If it didn't have such potentially devastating consequences, it would be laughable.\" \n \nHomeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke would not comment on the report, saying only that in releasing it on Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff will \"talk about nationwide assessments for interoperable communications.\" \n \nStill room for improvement in New York \nThe attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revealed major problems in how well emergency agencies were able to talk to each other during a catastrophe. Many firefighters climbing the World Trade Center towers died when they were unable to hear police radio warnings to leave the crumbling buildings. \n \nIn New York now, the report said, first responders were found to have well-established systems to communicate among each other — but not the best possible. Thirteen U.S. cities scored better than New York. \n \nJust over a year ago, Hurricane Katrina underscored communication problems when radio transmissions were hindered because the storm's winds toppled towers. \n \nIn the study, communities were judged in three categories: operating procedures in place, use of communications systems and how effectively local governments have coordinated in preparation for a disaster. \n \nOverall, 16 percent of the communities were given the highest score for the communications procedures they have in place and 1 percent got the lowest rating. \n \nNineteen percent got the top grade for their plans for coordinating during a disaster and 8 percent received the worst; and 21 percent got the best mark for how well they use their communications equipment while 4 percent got the bottom rating. \n \nMost of the areas surveyed included cities and their surrounding communities, based on the assumption that in a major crisis emergency personnel from all local jurisdictions would respond. \n \nLos Angeles got advanced grades in procedures and use of emergency communications systems and a well-developed grade in coordination of governance. \n \nSan Francisco, by comparison, received intermediate grades in governance and procedures, and a well-developed grade in use of systems. \n \nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, $2.9 billion in federal grant money has been distributed to state and local first responders for the improvement of their emergency communications systems. \n \nTV industry must make changes \nCongress has also ordered that the television broadcast industry vacate a portion of the radio spectrum to make it available for public safety communications. Lawmakers have also created a new office at the Homeland Security Department to oversee the issue, though they have yet to provide money for it. \n \nThe areas with the six best scores were judged advanced in all three categories. The cities with the lowest grades had reached the early implementation stage for only one category, and intermediate levels for the other two categories. \n \nChicago, Cleveland and Baton Rouge, for example, were judged to have accomplished the early stage of government coordination. Mandan, N.D., and the territory of American Samoa were both found to have gotten to the early stage of their actual usage of interoperable emergency communications and rated intermediate in governance and procedures. \n \nTammy Lapp, the emergency coordinator for Mandan and Morton County, N.D., said she was not surprised by the low ranking. \n \n\"We knew with our limited funds, we were going to fall short,\" she said. \n\n\n" .

The software is aimed at boosting their intelligence and independence so that they can roll around the Red Planet with less help from humans. \n \n\"We're teaching an old dog new tricks,\" said John Callas, the mission project manager with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the NASA agency in charge of the rovers. \n \nAmong the rovers' new skills is the ability to automatically recognize and transmit to Earth photographs that they take of swirling dust devils or floating clouds. They can also independently decide whether it is safe to extend its robotic arm to sample a piece of rock. \n \nBefore, scientists had to painstakingly dissect thousands of images just to find the frames they need and decide for the rovers whether to use their arms. The high-tech upgrades should help save time — as much as a day because scientists on Earth don't have to study a rock before sending commands to the robot to pick it up. \n \nIf successful, the changes could get incorporated into future Mars missions. \n \nSpirit and Opportunity were also fitted with a new navigation system that allows them to think several steps ahead when faced with an obstacle, allowing them to back out of a dead end or even navigate a maze on their own, Callas said. The geologic robots have previously tackled one problem at a time. \n \nSpirit landed three years ago Wednesday and Opportunity on Jan. 24, 2004. Entering their fourth year of exploration, both golf cart-sized vehicles have long outlasted their missions, originally planned for about three months. While scientists are impressed by the rovers' longevity, they admit the robots could die at any time. \n \nThe rovers' biggest accomplishment is uncovering geologic evidence that water once flowed on Mars. Spirit is currently studying rocks and soil samples near a Martian ridge while Opportunity is circling the rim of a massive crater for possible ways in. \n\n\n" .

        nif:isString    "Home Depot CEO Nardelli quits \nHome-improvement retailer's chief executive had been criticized over pay \n \nATLANTA - Bob Nardelli abruptly resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive of The Home Depot Inc. after a six-year tenure that saw the world’s largest home improvement store chain post big profits but left investors disheartened by poor stock performance. \n \nNardelli has also been under fire by investors for his hefty pay and is leaving with a severance package valued at about $210 million. He became CEO in December 2000 after being passed over for the top job at General Electric Co., where Nardelli had been a senior executive. \n \nHome Depot said Nardelli was being replaced by Frank Blake, its vice chairman, effective immediately. \n \nBlake’s appointment is permanent, Home Depot spokesman Jerry Shields said. What he will be paid was not immediately disclosed, Shields said. The company declined to make Blake available for comment, and a message left for Nardelli with his secretary was not immediately returned. \n \nBefore Wednesday’s news, Home Depot’s stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over. \n \nNardelli’s sudden departure was stunning in that he told The Associated Press as recently as Sept. 1 that he had no intention of leaving, and a key director also said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. \n \nAsked in that interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving Home Depot, Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn’t. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, “Selling hammers.” \n \nFor The Home Depot? \n \n“Absolutely,” he said at the time. \n \nHome Depot said Nardelli’s decision to resign was by mutual agreement with the Atlanta-based company. \n \n“We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of The Home Depot over the past six years. Under Bob’s tenure, the company made significant and necessary investments that greatly improved the company’s infrastructure and operations, expanded our markets to include wholesale distribution and new geographies, and undertook key strategic initiatives to strengthen the company’s foundation for the future,” Home Depot’s board said in a statement. \n \nNardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader, a former college football player and friend of President Bush. He helped increase revenue and profits at Home Depot and increase the number of stores the company operates to more than 2,000. Home Depot’s earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the public discussion about his pay and the company’s stock price had become a distraction. \n \nIndustry experts and analysts said his departure and Blake’s ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot. \n \n“This is not about strategy or vision,” said James Senn, director of Robinson College’s Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University. “This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. Bob has run into some problems there. The second is execution.” \n \nThe Home Depot board also announced that Carol Tome, its chief financial officer, and Joe DeAngelo, its executive vice president for Home Depot Supply, will be assuming additional responsibilities. \n \nTome will be assuming responsibility for mergers and acquisitions, credit services and additional strategic responsibilities. DeAngelo was appointed to the newly created position of chief operating officer. \n \nNardelli and Home Depot have agreed to terms of a separation agreement that would provide for payment of the amounts he is entitled to receive under his pre-existing employment contract entered into in 2000. Under this agreement, Nardelli will receive consideration currently valued at about $210 million. \n \nThe package includes a cash severance payment of $20 million, the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at approximately $77 million and unvested options with an intrinsic value of approximately $7 million. It also includes payments of earned bonuses and long-term incentive awards of approximately $9 million, account balances under the Company’s 401(k) plan and other benefit programs currently valued at approximately $2 million, previously earned and vested deferred shares with an approximate value of $44 million, the present value of retirement benefits currently valued at approximately $32 million and $18 million for other entitlements under his contract. Those entitlements will be paid over a four-year period and will be forfeited if he does not honor his contractual obligations. \n \nNardelli has also agreed not to compete with the company for one year, and not to solicit employees or customers of the company for four years. \n \nHome Depot did not say what Nardelli would be doing next. \n \nIn conjunction with the management changes, the board also announced that it had waived the retirement age of 72 and has asked John L. Clendenin, Claudio X. Gonzales and Milledge A. Hart III to stand for re-election at the 2007 annual shareholders meeting. This action was taken to retain these directors’ experience. Home Depot said the action was temporary. \n\n\n" .

Now he is under interrogation about the goals of his filming,” said an adviser to the prime minister, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. “He was arrested by Iraqi forces.” \n \nThe video contained audio of witnesses telling Saddam to “Go to hell” and of the former leader responding to taunts that his tormentors were being unmanly. It surfaced on Al-Jazeera television and the Internet late Saturday, the day Saddam was hanged.  \n \nThe Associated Press quoted an unidentified adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki as saying the man arrested was “an official who supervised the execution.”  \n \nAl-Maliki announced Tuesday that he had ordered an investigation into the conduct of the execution team, who could be heard taunting Saddam in the moments before his hanging. \n \nA U.S. military spokesman, meanwhile, said the United States would have handled the execution differently had it been in charge.  \n \n‘I did not see him taking pictures’ \nOn Wednesday, an Iraqi prosecutor who was also present at the execution denied a report that he had accused national security adviser al-Rubaie of possible responsibility for the leaked video. \n \n“I am not accusing Mowaffak al-Rubaie, and I did not see him taking pictures,” Munqith al-Faroon, a prosecutor in the case that sent Saddam to the gallows, told The Associated Press. \n \n“But I saw two of the government officials who were ... present during the execution taking all the video of the execution, using the lights that were there for the official taping of the execution. They used mobile phone cameras. I do not know their names, but I would remember their faces,” al-Faroon said in a telephone interview. \n \nThe prosecutor said the two officials were openly taking video pictures, which are believed to be those which appeared on Al-Jazeera satellite and a Web site within hours of Saddam’s execution. \n \nThe New York Times on Wednesday reported that al-Faroon told the newspaper “one of two men he had seen holding a cell phone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein’s last moments up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki’s national security adviser.” \n \nThe Times said it had been unable to reach al-Rubaie for comment. AP also could not reach him Wednesday. His secretary said the security adviser, a close aide to al-Maliki, was in Najaf and would not return until later. \n \nChants of ‘Muqtada’ \nAl-Faroon said there were 14 Iraqi officials, including himself and another prosecutor, as well as three hangmen present for the execution. All the officials, he said, were flown by U.S. helicopter to the former military intelligence facility where Saddam was put to death in an execution chamber used by his own security men for years. \n \nThe prosecutor said he believed all mobile phones had been confiscated before the flight and that some of the officials’ bodyguards, who arrived by car, had smuggled the camera phones to the two officials he had seen taking the video pictures. \n \nAl-Arabiya television reported that the person under arrest is one of the guards who was a member of the execution team, according to an MSNBC translator. There was no further information about whether the person under arrest was a guard or other official. \n \nSome of the last words Saddam heard, according to the leaked cell phone video, were a chant of “Muqtada, Muqtada, Muqtada,” a reference to Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical anti-American Shiite cleric, whose Mahdi Army militia is believed responsible for many killings that have targeted Sunnis and driven many from their homes. \n \nAl-Sadr’s father was killed by Saddam. The militant cleric is a key al-Maliki backer. \n \nU.S. response \nMaj. Gen. William Caldwell, a U.S. military spokesman, told reporters Wednesday that the execution would have been handled differently had U.S. forces been in charge.  \n \n“If you are asking me: ‘Would we have done things differently?’ Yes, we would have. But that’s not our decision. That’s the government of Iraq’s decision,” he .  \n \nHe added that Saddam was “dignified” and “courteous” as he was transferred from US military control to Iraqi custody before he was executed.  \n \n“He spoke very well to our military police, as he always had, and when getting off at the prison site he said farewell to his interpreter; he thanked the military police squad,” Caldwell said. \n\n\n" .

When she returns, Walters said, “We will all welcome her back with open arms.” \n \nWalters also took a moment to smooth things over with The Donald, who got all riled up when O’Donnell said on “The View” that he had been “bankrupt so many times.” \n \n“ABC has asked me to say this just to clarify things, and I will quote: ‘Donald Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. Several of his casino companies have filed for business bankruptcies. They are out of bankruptcy now,”’ Walters said. \n \nO’Donnell and Trump have been feuding since he announced last month that Miss USA Tara Conner, whose title had been in jeopardy because of underage drinking, would keep her crown. Trump is the owner of the Miss Universe Organization, which includes Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. \n \nThe 44-year-old outspoken moderator of “The View,” who joined the show in September, said Trump’s news conference with Conner had annoyed her “on a multitude of levels” and that the twice-divorced real estate mogul had no right to be “the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America.” \n \nTrump fired back, calling O’Donnell a “loser” and a “bully,” among other insults, in various media interviews. \n \nHe is the host of NBC’s “The Apprentice,” which begins its new season Sunday. \n\n\n" .

Do I need to exercise more? Spend less? Set aside more quality time for friends and family? The resolution list goes on and on — much like that interminable karaoke version of “Santa Baby” at this year’s holiday party. \n \nUnfortunately, since I was the one holding the microphone, this year’s resolution seems painfully clear: Cut back on the alcohol intake. \n \nNot that I drink a lot — usually just a glass of wine with dinner, if that — but I’ve read that even one drink a day can adversely affect my health. \n \nAlso, a recent study by the Ma
