The committee meets biannually to promote cooperation in foreign affairs, trade and technology. \n\n Habibi, who is accompanied by  Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi  , is expected to meet Syrian President  Hafez Assad   during his three-day visit. \n\n Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally and supported the Persian state during the 1980-88  Iran-Iraq war . str-bm-jbm \n\n" .

He granted temporary custody to the  National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals  . \n\n But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and three to  Switzerland  , Trittin last week said Germany would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its zoos. \n\n Others argue the elephants may face a worse fate if they don't come to Germany. \n\n Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in  parliament   Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals from being  put to sleep   in South Africa. \n\n In addition, the cultural minister of  Saxony , of which Dresden is the capital, asked the state's 740,000 school children to write letters of protest urging Tritten to allow the elephants into Germany.

It also said the plant's  carbon dioxide   emissions would be 90 percent lower than plants using natural gas. \n\n  Norway   is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields. Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from  hydroelectric plants  . \n\n Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen,  nitrogen   and carbon dioxide. \n\n Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of  Oslo . \n\n" .

He was 58. \n\n Garcia joined The Associated Press office in Managua in 1986 after working for  Radio Nicaragua  , where he was director of  short-wave   broadcasts, and after helping found a local news agency, Agencia de Noticias Nueva Nicaragua. \n\n For the AP, he covered the war between the  Sandinista   government and  Contra   rebels, the Sandinistas' loss of power at the ballot box and the country's sometimes turbulent effort to put years of war behind it. \n\n He also reported on  volcanic eruptions  , the 1996 visit of  Pope John Paul II   and the ravages of  Hurricane Mitch   in 1998. \n\n ''He worked under very difficult conditions created by a civil war but always managed to maintain total objectivity and a fair vision under pressure in reporting for The Associated Press,'' said Eloy Aguilar, the AP bureau chief for  Mexico   and  Central America  . \n\n Garcia was born in Nandasmo, a town about 15 miles south of Managua. He attended the  National Autonomous University of Nicaragua  . \n\n Garcia suffered a series of illnesses last year, including  diabetes   and  cancer . He died Saturday night. \n\n He was buried in Nandasmo on Sunday. He is survived by his wife, Ana Leonor Hernandez, and four daughters. \n\n" .

It came after seasonal warming  evaporated   the  carbon dioxide    ice sheet   that caps the  Martian north pole   during part of the year. \n\n \n\n Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the  Viking Orbiter   spacecraft. \n\n \n\n Astronomers used a  wide field planetary camera   on Hubble to photograph Mars during the planet's closest approach to Earth in nearly eight years. \n\n \n\n Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up. \n\n \n\n Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm, and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived  phenomenon . \n\n" .

However, Israel fell behind schedule when it held up Cabinet ratification of the accord by two weeks. \n\n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the airport would start operating next week, but has not set a date. \n\n On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials staged a four-hour drill, said Fayez Zeidan, head of the Palestinian  Civil Aviation Authority  . \n\n About 100 Palestinian airport employees and 50  Israelis   who will share  security   duties played the roles of passengers and airport personnel. For lack of a plane, the \"passengers'' arrived by  bus . \n\n Zeidan said the exercise covered arrival and departure procedures, including passport checks as well as customs and luggage inspection. \n\n He said the airport was ready for operation. \"We just need to hear from the Israelis,'' Zeidan said. sa-kl \n\n" .

It involves a  three dimensional   method known as  Stereotaxic Surgery  , which is also used in conjunction with  radiation   equipment known as the  Linear Accelerator  . \n\n With this new technology, doctors are able to removal cancerous tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio surgery, every step is controlled by computers and patients are  conscious   while they undergo treatment. \n\n This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as Artero Venous  Malformation   (the  clotting   of veins or blood  capillaries  in the brain).So far, ninety per cent of the radio surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in hospital for three days. Additionally, there is no need for patients to shave their heads and radio surgery causes no scar, little blood loss and is not expensive.For more information contact the hospital at srisiam ksc.th.com. \n\n" .

Starting in September, the service will be extended to five other cities: Duesseldorf, Cologne,  Bonn  ,  Wuerzburg   and Nuremberg. \n\n Passengers flying on Lufthansa partners  United   and  SAS  would also be able to use the service, he said. \n\n The airline and railway said they'd form a working group to resolve such problems as security checks on the luggage and making sure the bags get to the airport from the train station on time. \n\n Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig said his railway also would work to coordinate schedules better with Lufthansa flights to make connections easier, and allow for combined train and plane tickets.

        nif:isString    "   Alaska Hiker Killed by  Bear  \n\n  ANCHORAGE  ,  Alaska   (AP) -- A man on a day hike in a rural area was killed when a bear bit his head,  Alaska State Troopers   said Wednesday. \n\n \n\n Kenneth Cates, 53, was found Wednesday morning on a horse trail in a heavily wooded area of the  Kenai National Wildlife Refuge   near his hometown of  Soldotna  . \n\n \n\n The attack happened about six miles off a busy road. The area is about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage. \n\n \n\n The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday. \n\n \n\n His only visible wound was a single bite to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife Conservation. \n\n \n\n State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed. \n\n \n\n Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber  rifle   and two spent shell casings were found near the body, along with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal. \n\n \n\n \"We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. \n\n \n\n Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since Feb. 8, 1998, when  Audelio Luis Cortes  , 40, was killed while working on a  seismic   crew in the  Swanson River    oil field   near  Kenai . Cortes also died from a single head bite. \n\n" .

About 6,000 passengers were cleared from the terminal during the search, airline officials said. \n\n \n\n Eighty more flights were canceled today and numerous others were delayed as the effects of the shutdown lingered, Price said, adding that the carrier hoped to be back to a normal schedule by this afternoon. \n\n \n\n The man was not found and Chicago police said officers turned up nothing suspicious. \n\n \n\n He was leaving a  concourse   and heading toward the  baggage claim  area when he turned back and ran up a one-way staircase leading to the concourse, United spokesman Matthew Triaca said. Guards are stationed at the staircase, but the man ran past them. \n\n \n\n No United flights left the terminal during the search and only a few landed at other United gates. Some flights resumed by early evening. \n\n" .
